# Swan Input Method

[简体中文](./README.md)

Swan Input Method is a deeply customized Android IME based on [Fcitx5 for Android](https://github.com/fcitx5-android/fcitx5-android).  
The current app name is `天鹅输入法`, and the main package name is `org.fxboomk.fcitx5.android`.

This fork mainly strengthens two areas:

- Clipboard workflow: it turns local clipboard, cross-device clipboard, and image/file clipboard handling into a more complete workflow.
- Prediction and extensibility: it keeps the Fcitx5 multi-engine architecture while further improving extensible scenarios such as the RIME plugin.

## Recent Updates

Recent commits have mainly focused on the following areas:

- Keyboard layout editing keeps getting stronger:
  - Text keyboard layout JSON now supports direct key color definitions, making fine-grained theme and color customization easier.
  - Toolbar buttons now support icon fonts, so buttons can use glyph-based icons in addition to drawable resources.
- Keyboard UI and interaction details received another round of focused fixes:
  - `ButtonsAdjustingWindow` now uses touch-based dragging, which makes the overlay adjustment experience more stable.
  - Keyboard layouts are reapplied after theme changes, and size updates are also refreshed when floating keyboard state changes.
  - Voice input preference conditions and punctuation position enum mapping were fixed so settings better match actual behavior.
- Toolbar and popup visuals/stability were polished further:
  - The input bar now uses a dedicated hide-keyboard icon for clearer semantics.
  - A popup crash when candidate lists are empty has been fixed, reducing edge-case crashes.
  - Dialog colors such as the input method picker were refined for a more consistent visual style.
- Project infrastructure continues tracking upstream:
  - The latest upstream `master` changes were merged, and `.gitmodules` was updated to keep the main app and submodule build chain aligned.

## Highlights

### 1. Stronger clipboard workflow

- Clipboard categories in the main app:
  - Local
  - Other Devices
  - Images & Files
  - All
- Image entries can show thumbnails.
- URL entries support an `Open link` context action.
- Image entries support a `View image` context action via the system default app.
- Image and file clipboard items are preserved as URI-based entries whenever possible, so file sending works beyond plain text.
- Long-text clipboard entries (more than 10 characters) support tokenized/chunked presentation for easier browsing and reuse.
- Clipboard history limits can be configured per category.

### 2. Clipboard sync plugin

The project already integrates the `clipboard-sync` plugin build chain and can build/install it together with the main app.

Currently supported clipboard sync backends:

- [`OneClip`](https://oneclip.cloud/)
- [`ClipCascade`](https://github.com/NOBB2333/ClipCascade_go)
- [`SyncClipboard`](https://github.com/Jeric-X/SyncClipboard)

Plugin capabilities include:

- Automatically pulling desktop clipboard records to Android.
- Supporting multiple clipboard content types including text, images, and files.
- Pushing Android clipboard content back to the server.
- Manually uploading clipboard entries to the server when on-demand sync is needed.
- Background keep-alive, reconnect logic, foreground service mode, and quick settings tile control.
- Sync filters for:
  - text length
  - file extensions
  - maximum file size
- Built-in settings for connection testing, push testing, and system clipboard permission guidance.

If your workflow is “copy on desktop, input on phone” or “copy on phone, receive on desktop”, this fork treats it as a core feature.

### 3. Prediction and input-method extensibility

- Keeps the original Fcitx5 multi-language input framework.
- Chinese input continues to support Pinyin, Shuangpin, Wubi, Cangjie, and table-based input methods.
- RIME plugin support remains available for custom schemas, dictionaries, and advanced configuration.
- [`librime` (the Rime plugin)](https://github.com/boomker/librime) prediction capability has been enhanced so it can learn from user input history and supports backup of prediction data.
- Prediction, suggestion, and language-model related capabilities from libime and the Chinese plugin stack are preserved.
- The keyboard layer also keeps gaining configurable features such as MacroKey support, Shift behavior switches, and popup gesture highlight improvements.

### 4. Keyboard layout and popup preset sharing

- Text keyboard layouts and popup presets can be shared via QR codes.
- Shared data can be imported either by camera scanning or from a file.
- QR images can be previewed before sharing so you can verify the content first.
- Text keyboard layout JSON also supports direct key color configuration, making it easier to share complete visual layout presets.

### 5. Toolbar and UI customization

- Toolbar buttons support both icon-font and drawable-based icon sources, making style unification easier.
- The input bar includes a more semantic hide-keyboard icon for better visual clarity.
- UI details such as the input method picker and keyboard adjustment overlay continue to be refined, and layout refresh is more stable when themes change.

### 6. Multi-theme switching

- Multiple themes can be selected for both light mode and dark mode.
- Tapping the light/dark switch button cycles through the selected themes of the current mode.
- Each mode can keep multiple themes for fast visual switching.

### 7. Preserving the Fcitx5 plugin architecture

- The main app still loads additional input engines or feature plugins through the plugin mechanism.
- Beyond the main app, this repository also includes plugins/components such as RIME, Anthy, UniKey, Thai, Hangul, Sayura, and Jyutping.
- Compatibility with external plugin installation and integration scenarios is preserved.
